This project aims to conduct a comprehensive comparative study on the three popular JavaScript frameworks/libraries: React.js, Vue.js, and Angular, focusing on their suitability and performance in Single-Page Application (SPA) development. Alongside the study, the project also involves the development of algorithms for evaluating these frameworks based on various criteria.

## üíª Objectives 

The primary objectives of this project are:

- To compare the key features, strengths, and weaknesses of React.js, Vue.js, and Angular.
- To assess the performance metrics such as speed, memory usage, and rendering capabilities of each framework.
- To develop algorithms that can objectively evaluate the suitability of each framework for different types of SPA projects.
- To provide insights and recommendations for developers and organizations in selecting the appropriate framework for their projects.

## üõ† Technologies

The following technologies were employed in the creation of this project:

- React.js: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, providing a component-based architecture for efficient development.
JavaScript (ES6+): The primary programming language for React development, offering modern syntax and features.
- HTML: Used for structuring the web pages and JSX (JavaScript XML) within React components.
- CSS (or CSS-in-JS): Stylesheets or CSS-in-JS solutions for styling React components and layout.
- Node.js: A JavaScript runtime environment used for building server-side and networking applications. Often used for tooling and server-side rendering with React.
- npm or Yarn: Package managers for managing dependencies and scripts in the project.
- Jest or React Testing Library: Testing frameworks for unit and integration testing of React components and applications.
- Git: Version control system for tracking changes in the project codebase and collaborating with other developers.
- GitHub: A platform for hosting Git repositories and facilitating collaboration among developers.

These technologies collectively form the core toolset for developing modern web applications using React.js.
