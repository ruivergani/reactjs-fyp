This project aims to conduct a comprehensive comparative study on the three popular JavaScript frameworks/libraries: React.js, Vue.js, and Angular, focusing on their suitability and performance in Single-Page Application (SPA) development. Alongside the study, the project also involves the development of algorithms for evaluating these frameworks based on various criteria.
